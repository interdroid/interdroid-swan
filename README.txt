What is Swan?
---------------------

This project aims to make it easy to build context aware applications.
The goal is to make it easy to make applications which take advantage
of context in powerful and new ways while also minimizing energy
consumption.  Smartphones have the power to dramatically change our
lives and context holds the key to unlocking that power.
